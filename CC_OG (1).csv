56993,3/24/15,Payday loan,Payday loan,Can't stop charges to bank account,Can't stop charges to bank account,"I took out a Loan from Cash Central XXXX, Al for {$300.00} sense that time I lost my job and also my medications went through the roof so I was unable to pay the Loan back. Every sense that time I have been receiving phone calls everyday. Not a day pass they are calling me and they always call from a different number so I never know who it is calling. They have caused me to pay out so much money at my Bank, at the time my Bank was XXXX XXXX in XXXX, Al. They have caused me to pay out hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees, money that I could have paid them with but they would not stop trying to debit my account. They call every day starting at around XXXX I am telling them the same thing each time they call me that I do not have any money to pay them now if I did have the money I would pay them each month until I paid them up but until my income increase I am not able to pay them. I am on a fix income and I can not pay them now and I can not tell you when I can pay because I do n't know my self. I am so tired of the harassing phone calls I am on XXXX and XXXX and every day it gets worse and worse and I ca n't keep putting up with them calling every day like this it works on my nerves and it up sets me really bad. I told XXXX people that call me that I would try to pay something next month and she screamed at me and said next month, why next month? I told her I had to see how my bills would run and I could not give her and amount so to how much I can pay. I know even if I could pay them it would not be more than {$4.00} or {$5.00} dollars if that much. They just keep calling and calling every day. They have been doing this for the pass 6 or 7 months and I ca n't take it any longer. My nerves are to bad and they runs my XXXX XXXX up by calling every day. If they were to slow down the calls except to may be once a month then that would be helpful a little but I still do n't know if I would have any money to pay them even then. I can try if I have any money left but I seriously doubt it not right now until my bills comes down. I am paying high bills right now and it is taking all of my money to just keep my house going so that I can have some where to live. It 's not that I do n't want to pay them but I do not have the money now. They ruined my Bank account and I had to close it because of all the over draft fees the Bank was charging me. Each day they sent the debit through for the {$300.00} and some dollars and every day the Bank charged me {$38.00} per transaction, I paid out a lot of money to the Bank for these transactions, money they could have had if they would not have kept trying to debit my account. I am so tired of this and I do n't know nothing else to do except not answer the phone but If I did that I could miss important phone calls from other people I need to talk to. I am just tired of the harassing phone calls. This is not good for my illness. Regardless of what I say to them they still call every day. I just want the calls to stop. I will pay something when ever I can. _x000D_",Company chooses not to provide a public response,"Community Choice Financial, Inc.",AL,351XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,3/24/15,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1299258

This loan was opened by my dad several years ago without my knowledge. I discovered the loan was opened in my name 3 years later when applying for a car loan. My dad advised that he would continue to pay on the loan, and not to worry. Never mind the fact that I never received a notice or statement from Wells Fargo concerning this loan prior to me reviewing my credit file. My dad is now retired and due to XXXX is unable to maintain the monthly bill for this loan. _x000D__x000D_Although I never agreed to this loan, I do not want to pursue criminal charges against my dad, BUT I do not agree with Wells ' Fargo business practices concerning my dispute about this loan. This loan has gone into default twice and has been reported as 30 days late to my credit bureau. I 've told my dad countless times that if he thinks he is not going to be able to make the payment to contact me before it becomes late so that I can try to cover the payment. However, that has not happened. My mom did let me know that due to my dad being out of work and without a car due to a car accident, that he will not be able to make a payment on time. _x000D__x000D_I contacted Wells Fargo today, because I feel that I 'm left out of the loop in terms of when a payment is due, if it 's behind, etc. The only time I 'm made aware that a payment is due, is when it 's already BEHIND!!! How is that fair for a consumer who is only trying to do the right thing by repaying a loan that was never requested by her? Additionally, my request to Wells Fargo was to grant me access to view this account online, so that I do not find myself in the same predicament and wind up with another 30 day late reporting on my credit file. The representative, although pleasant, did not have any options to assist me. She advised me as a co-signer that I do not have access to view the loan online, only the borrower can, and also advised to get a monthly statement, I would have to call in and request it!!! Again how is this fair??? _x000D__x000D_I 've come to terms that Wells Fargo is not going to do the right thing and remove my name from this loan, but to not give me all the tools to manage the loan, by granting me online access, which is how I maintain all my other bills, which are paid on time, might I add!!! Then to state I have to call in to request a statement each month is mind-boggling, BUT if a payment is behind, there is no hesitation in reporting this on MY credit file. I feel that this is not only unfair, by unlawful, and it feels they are putting me in a position where I always have to worry about whether this bill is going to be paid on time. It has caused me great stress, and has prevented me from being able to obtain a competitive home loan. With this recent 30 day late on my credit file, my score dropped XXXX pts.!!! _x000D__x000D_My request from Wells Fargo at this time is to do the right thing, which would be to remove these 30 day lates from my credit file, since they do not give me the proper tools to manage this loan. I also request that if they are not going to remove my name from this loan that they also grant me access to view and make payments online, and mail monthly statements without me having to request them each month.

( SEE ATTACHED DOC ) How can an invalidated debt become a charge-off? _x000D__x000D_I am in dispute of this charge-off. A charge-off is a notation on your credit report indicating that the original lender has written off the charge as unlikely to ever be paid. An account that is 120 to 180 days past due usually will be charged off. In this situation, I find it particularly troubling that XXXX would charge-off a debt at such a stage. ESPECIALLY WITH A {$00.00} BALANCE. ( SEE ACCOUNT HISTORY. _x000D_A charge-off is an internal bookkeeping measure taken by a creditor that requires a concurrent finding by them that they now considers the debt to be "" uncollectible. '' In this case, It is pretty far stretch for them to conclude that this debt was uncollectible when it has not even reached the stage of being reportable to a CRA as a 30-day late, and I never received notification that I owed this debt. _x000D_Charge-offs are required by statute for many creditors when a debt has reached a certain level of delinquency, usually 180 days. The reason for compelling charge-offs is to prevent corporations from overstating their assets, of which unpaid debts are a receivable asset, in their financial reportings, and thus misleading stockholders and others of the financial stability of a corporation. _x000D__x000D_Accordingly, I can show any judge that this accounts is inaccurate and that XXXX has violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act by ignoring my requests to investigate the items.

Debtors deserve the right to dispute a debt and request an investigation of inaccurate reporting. Allowing colleges and universities to avoid their responsibility as a furnisher would contradict the purpose of this consumer minded statute. _x000D_If this final request does not prompt you to conduct a proper investigation of the accounts in question, and send proof to me of said investigation, I will file a civil suit. for damages.

96348,1/28/16,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Can't repay my loan,Can't decrease my monthly payments,"Perhaps this is a common problem. I have had private law school loans since 1998. These loans are currently split between XXXX service providers - XXXX ( formerly XXXX XXXX ) and Access Group ( ACS ). Since my loans went into repayment, I never missed a payment, and paid my full amount owed every month. However, in the last couple of years, I 've had some challenges. I had to take time off from full-time employment due to some health issues, and we needed to relocate for my husband 's job across the country. I had a baby. I needed to stay home for a while. With both loan providers, I was able to suspend the federal loans, but the private ones have been more problematic. I am told I have no other options with those at this point. The monthly for ACS is {$270.00} and the monthly for XXXX is {$230.00}. The financial stress on our family is significant because of this, as I am not bringing in an income and not receiving any type of unemployment assistance. The lenders claim I have no options. I asked if it might be possible for me to pay a lower amount each month until I obtain employment. The answer was no, that this would still be considered default, even if I paid XXXX-XXXX percent of the amount owed each month. Essentially paying a substantial portion counts for nothing. I feel that this makes no sense and is borderline predatory. It seems as if trying to work out an arrangement with them is impossible. I understand why people give up and do n't pay at all. However, I have excellent credit and it 's important to me to retain this. It 's going to wipe out our savings over the next few months. I think the unwillingness to work with clients during financial difficulties is a real problem. This is not credit card debt. Most of us with these loans are responsible consumers. The failure to work with an individual who is willing to pay the maximum possible in his/her current financial situation, is something that I felt was worth documenting. Thank you for your efforts to monitor business practices by the student loan industry. _x000D_",Company chooses not to provide a public response,Access Group,CA,956XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,1/28/16,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1762465

99169,3/15/16,Debt collection,"Other (i.e. phone, health club, etc.)",False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"Back in XXXX I communicated with a collection agency named Continental Central Credit. I spoke to them because they had a collection account in their office which they were reporting on my credit report. When I spoke with this collection agency, I spoke with an individual by the name of XXXX XXXX. _x000D__x000D_XXXX XXXX was the collector who was in charge of this particular account. When I spoke with him, I explained my situation to him and we had agreed upon me paying an amount of {$700.00} as well as having the account removed from my credit report due to the unusual circumstances surrounding the nature of the debt. We agreed that I would post date a payment on the XXXX of XXXX because that is when I got paid for the month. I only get paid once a month. _x000D__x000D_I thought the situation was taken care of until I received another notice saying that they will sue me if I do n't pay the amount of the post dated payment as well as a {$25.00} Non sufficient fund fee. At this point I had my representative step in and try to figure out what was going on because I know I had funds in my bank account. In fact, because of this entire ordeal, I was forced to go to my bank and provide them documentation about the non sufficient funds to figure out what was happening and I also printed out a statement which shows I had money in the bank at that time. _x000D__x000D_After further review, my representative then noticed that the date the collection agency attempted to withdraw funds was listed the XXXX of XXXX and not the XXXX of XXXX as XXXX XXXX XXXX and I had agreed upon. My representative then spoke to the collection agency to ask why they were attempting to charge me non sufficient fund fees as well as threaten to sue me if they had attempted to withdraw funds on a date that was not agreed upon. The response that he received was truly exasperating. _x000D__x000D_The collector XXXX stated that we had n't agreed upon the XXXX but the XXXX. He claimed that to have it in by the XXXX it had to be withdrawn then. That statement was a complete falsehood. Besides the obvious fact that the XXXX was days after XXXX therefore chances are I did n't have money to spend, but it 's also days before I get paid and therefore I would never agree to such a deal. Furthermore, when my representative attempted to play nice and chalk it up to a whole misunderstanding and to offer them the same amount as before which was the {$700.00}, the collector said he could n't do it because the funds had to be withdrawn before the XXXX of XXXX. He also made a statement that the settlement offer was no longer valid. At this point my representative asked for the Supervisor. _x000D__x000D_The supervisor was named XXXX XXXX. he tried to explain to her the entire situation. He informed her that the funds withdrawal was according to their own documentation attempted on the wrong dates. He also informed her that I was willing to still pay the agreed upon amount. She would n't hear any of it. Although her tone was very cordial, she simply reiterated what the collector tried to tell me and instead of noticing that they had wronged me and were attempting to wrong me more, she tried to focus on why I was able to afford the full amount and therefore did not require a settlement. At this point they are being malicious and they have broken the law. _x000D__x000D_They essentially pulled a bait and switch on me. They lied to me in order to collect more money than agreed upon, attempted to withdraw money when they were n't supposed to, and now they are attempting to extort illegal non sufficient fees and treble damages. _x000D__x000D_At this point I am very upset and if they attempt to sue me for these ridiculous charges, I will counter sue. I ca n't believe a collection agency is allowed to operate like this. Please look into them as they should not be extorting people for money.

They are embarrassing me to all of my friends and family and I 'm currently only 12 days late on my payment. This has also happened in the past when I needed to pay late. I 've never paid my bill later than 14 days past due. This is clearly harassment. They will text if no one answers the phone even after I 've requested to never be communicated via text. They are claiming to my friends and family that I have not communicated to them when I 'm going to pay, and they are stating that they are just trying to help me, however there is no help that they could give. I have asked to be switched to a monthly payment instead of a payment every 2 weeks, which would be helpful, however they are unwilling to do so. I am still planning on making my payment as promised however they will not cease with the embarrassing phone calls to my friends and family. I have requested that they never call my friends and family again in the past due to their embarrassing and harassing behavior and they continue to do so if I 'm ever late for a payment.

I received a call from a Wells Fargo representative on XX/XX/XXXX as well as today RE my home equity loan that was supposedly in arrears. I told both representatives to be sure that call was recorded! I subsequently went to my local Wells Fargo branch in XXXX today, and was assisted by a teller named XXXX who was filling in because the manager was "" on leave '' and no assistant manager was available. _x000D_There is a 10 day grace period, and I have always taken advantage of it. I made my payment on XX/XX/XXXX, and the last day for the grace period was XX/XX/XXXX. The representative to whom I spoke on XX/XX/XXXX informed me that it takes 5 DAYS for the payment to be credited to my home equity loan. My husband personally spoke to the branch manager the week of XX/XX/XXXX, and the impression he got that was that I would receive no calls as long as payment was made by the due date VS the end of the grace period. T his is the 2ND time I have had a similar issue with Wells Fargo -- the last episode was in XX/XX/XXXX. In both situations, the payment was made BEFORE the end of the grace period. It also turns out that in both situations, the payment was incorrectly credited to another home equity loan that is just about paid off. _x000D_What I really found offensive was being asked if I was in arrears on my primary mortgage during the XX/XX/XXXX conversation. Additionally I had to verify my employer of 31 YEARS as well as my home address where we have lived since XXXX. This information had to be verified AGAIN during my conversation with XXXX XXXX today. He could not have been more courteous given how irate I was about this situation. _x000D_XXXX who looked into the situation @ the local branch had suggested that I call the number on the payment coupon to speak to a supervisor. That was a mistake as well. Before I was allowed to be put through to the supervisor, XXXX XXXX, I was asked the SAME questions that I had verified 2-3 hours earlier!! When I had spoken to XXXX earlier, he made reference to notes that had been made during the XX/XX/XXXX conversation. Could this woman not have looked @ the same notes and assessed that I had already given that information?? This lady told me my voice was raised, and I agree it was because I was FRUSTRATED with the interactions I have been having with telephone representatives of your bank. I was FUMING!! I did apologize to all to whom I spoke. I informed them that I understood that they had to do their jobs. No expletives were ever used either. _x000D_How can Wells Fargo justify taking 5 DAYS to clear a check for a Wells Fargo home equity loan that is drawn on a Wells Fargo account that has PLENTY of reserve to cover the amount of the check?? Furthermore, I pay the loans at the branch where I have my checking account. _x000D_It seems that Wells Fargo wants to go back to the banking practices of XX/XX/XXXX. During that time, I worked as a private duty nurse to get through grad school, and the personal checks with which I was paid took 10 days to clear. My husband and I were living on a shoestring back then. I thought those antiquated banking practices went out the window, but obviously they have not. _x000D_I am fortunately in a position to pay my bills and to pay additional principal as well. Unfortunately, in this economy, others are not. I feel HARRSASSED by your policy of doing automatic calling when payment is past due but within the grace period.

I am yet to receive a copy of my promissory agreement.

In addition, if they are related companies coercing me to pay a debt not owed while holding my credit worthiness status hostage, the act of reporting the same debt to different agencies, changing account numbers, changing their corporation names and addresses is manipulative and is an exaggeration to deliberately coerce me to send money for a debt not owed. _x000D_Please advise me whether or not this practice is illegal in the State of Florida or under Federal Law.

I needed a forbearance for 3 months until school started as I would not have any income to make payments after I moved and prior to my new program. I contacted my lender 2 months in advance and asked what was available. Even knowing I would not have a job BUT that my income would resume ( I have documentation attesting that I have a salaried position beginning when I start my XXXX in the XX/XX/2016 ), they informed me that I would have to pay or have my credit downgraded.

Even still, my credit is near perfect ; I have not missed or been late on payments ; and if I have an issue I have always contacted them to adjust payment due dates, etc. I have been a good customer and want to pay what I owe.

The company in question, Select Portfolio Services ( SPS ) became the servicing agent for mortgage foreclosure that was filed in XXXX, and they took over servicing in XXXX. It is still being reported by them with a date of original delinquency of XXXX I contacted them to let them know that the date of original delinquency predated my dispute by over 7 years and must be deleted. Their response was essentially that it is the date of their last activity, not the date of original delinquency, that determines when the 7 year period begins to run, and that they will continue to report this delinquency until XXXX in direct violation of the FCRA. I sent them a letter demanding that they delete this entry but as of this date I have gotten no response. _x000D_The loss of the home and other substantial assets, like a pension, a job, etc, were the direct result of the XXXX mortgage debacle.

Their verification, which I believe is incorrect and I will further investigate, said the date of original delinquency is XXXX.

The account in question is from an apartment that had an agreement terminated XX/XX/XXXX. I discovered this debt by checking my credit report and inquiring about it. On my credit it shows as debt owed beginning XX/XX/XXXX, however it should be changed to the correct date of XX/XX/XXXX. No attempt has ever been made to reach me regarding this debt that began XX/XX/XXXX. I had cosigned for an apartment for a friend of mine and was never notified of the failure to pay a debt. The person who rented the apartment, informed the apartment management that she was unable to afford the apartment and that she would be terminating the agreement early. She was told that if she left within three days that she would only be charged the early termination fee of {$2400.00} and no other fees. She left within three days per their agreement and made an arrangement to pay {$100.00} per month until the debt was paid off. In addition to the deposit on the apartment that paid off {$220.00} toward the termination fee, she made one payment of {$100.00} XX/XX/XXXX and did not make payments afterward. Once I found out about my credit score I called National Credit Systems to resolve issue. They state that instead of the {$2400.00} ( minus the {$100.00} payment and the {$220.00} deposit ), we also owe {$1200.00} for less than 60 day notice, pro-rated rent at {$32.00}, {$180.00} for cleaning charges, {$3.00} in damages, and {$19.00} in water/sewage which brings us to a total of {$3900.00} ( minus the {$220.00} deposit ). We should not have to pay the {$1200.00} for not giving 60 days notice as the arrangement with management was to leave within 3 days to avoid these charges, and she met that arrangement. In addition to the complaints, I have contacted this company and was met with extreme hostility. They yell over me when I merely ask questions regarding this debt which is news to me. They hang up on me frequently. They are rude, condescending, and insulting. At this point, when I call them they simply put me on hold until they eventually hang up on me. The company agreed to consider the debt settled at XXXX % ( {$2500.00} ), and yet when I asked for that agreement to be made in writing prior to payment, they refused saying that I must take their oral agreement and nothing else. I do not trust them to keep their agreement without seeing something in writing. To reiterate, I would like National Credit Systems , Inc. to provide to the three credit reporting agencies the actual beginning date of this debt XX/XX/XXXX and not XX/XX/XXXX that they reported previously. I would also like the agreement they made with me at considering this debt settled at XXXX % to be put in writing prior to payment. _x000D__x000D_Desired Resolution : I would like National Credit Systems , Inc. to provide to the XXXX credit reporting agencies the actual beginning date of this debt XX/XX/XXXX and not XX/XX/XXXX that they reported previously.

The notice informs you that you have the right to validate/dispute the debt within 30 days of receiving the letter. If you do n't dispute the debt ( or request validation of the debt ) within the 30-day period, the collector has the legal right to assume that you agree the debt is valid. _x000D__x000D__x000D_Under the FDCPA, I have the right to request a validation of this debt. I request that you prove that I am indeed the party who is contractually obligated to pay off this debt. _x000D__x000D_I hope you are aware that reporting any invalidated information to major credit bureaus may constitute defamation of character.

The original balance was {$600.00}. My wife was contacted by the debt collection agency, Allied Collection Services, in XXXX, and they advised her that, unless she went into their office within 2 days, they would be forced to take legal action against her. She was understandably upset, so she went into their office, infant in tow, where they convinced her to sign several forms, including setting up a payment plan. She setup the payment auto-debit, according to their terms as they discussed in the office, and they withdrew a couple payments. However, in or around XXXX 2014, Allied filed suit and obtained a judgment against her, claiming she had not honored the terms of the payment arrangement. Upon review of the payment documentation, they required an initial payment of {$50.00} and subsequent payments of {$25.00} per month. My wife was led to believe that she only needed to setup the auto-debit for {$25.00} per month so she "" missed '' the first payment. Upon securing judgment against my wife, Allied Collection Services secured a wage garnishment order against me as well. Upon being advised by my employer of the wage garnishment, my wife contacted Allied Collection Services to attempt to resolve the matter, but they refused to offer any reasonable alternatives ( other than payment in full along with significant additional collection costs ). My wages were garnished until XXXX 2015, at significantly more than {$25.00} a month.

XXXX concerning XXXX or XXXX debts of the same account that appeared on XXXX public credit reports. I questioned the validity of the debts and the amounts owed. XXXX XXXX PROMISED to mail, to my home address which I provided during the conversation, an official document detailing the amounts owed, the original creditor and a statement guaranteeing that the debt amount would be updated on XXXX credit reports if I paid in full. XXXX XXXX explained that this was an attempt to collect a debt and any information obtained would be used for that purpose. I was told the document would be mailed within a few days. Today, XXXX XXXX, 2015, I viewed XXXX public credit reports and noted that the last reported date had been changed from XXXX/XXXX/2011 to XXXX/XXXX/2015. Instead of providing me with an official document or notice that the debt was owed, National Credit Systems Inc. updated their data with XXXX credit reporting agencies as an malicious attempt to place negative data on my credit report for an additional 7 years. The original negative information was scheduled for deletion approximately less than 1 year from the date that I called them to resolve the matter. I have contacted the original creditor prior to contacting National Credit Systems Inc. and was told that they no longer own the debt. My contract is with the original creditor, XXXX. I have no contract with National Credit Systems Inc. and they refuse to provide with any documentation to support their claim of ownership or purchase of the debt.

In my opinion, considering the amount that this collection agency claims I owe them for debt that they intercepted from the original creditor, a letter or formal communication of some sort is not an unreasonable request.

I never heard anything back from the doctor 's office after that nor did I get any information from the insurance company stating that I owed any money.

XXXX was from PDQ Services Inc and the other was from XXXX but with the PDQ Services address and information.

After that I still noticed that PDQ had the information on my credit report and I told them that I thought this violated my privacy rights and HIPAA as it showed my potential medical condition.

Neither PDQ, XXXX or the credit reporting agencies wanted to listen to my plea. I honestly feel that I have been taken advantage of and become a victim of shoddy medical collection practices. I also think that the doctor never attempted to contact me as this could have easily been paid in the early stages if only I had been contacted. I asked the credit reporting agencies to verify the methods and they basically gave me a nonchalant answer. They claimed to have verified the collection but could n't have as PDQ and the doctor sent me a letter stating that they were not going to address my complaint. Everyone ignored my pleas after I paid the account and all they wanted was their money. They had no concern for my rights as a citizen. The credit reporting agency says that they mask reports when sending out medical information but I am inclined to disagree as I see poor reporting from them each time I look at my credit reports now. PDQ does not bargain in good faith and should have never had my medical information in the first place as they have no business associate agreement with the doctor. I asked for this but it was never given which leads me to believe that they are handling sensitive information without a need.

The payment is $ XXXX but I always pay {$200.00}. Over the years I frequently paid well before each month 's due date so that I would not forget. Recently, I received an email that my XXXX, 2016 payment, due on XXXX/XXXX/2016, was past due.

I should be clear again that I did n't overpay XXXX by {$200.00}. I made a separate payment of the same monthly amount that I always had, frequently very early, with no issue at all. I was told that the XXXX/XXXX/2016 payment could not simply be applied to XXXX but had to be refunded. I was then told that, because I do n't have a Wells Fargo checking account, that my payment would have to be refunded by mail, which would take "" a minimum of 3 weeks. '' I was having this conversation with Wells Fargo Customer Service on XXXX/XXXX/2016, 6 days after the XXXX due date. This meant that Wells Fargo 's own process for refunding a payment that should have applied to XXXX would indeed have made me delinquent for the month. Is it fair that a financial institution can structure payments and refunds in such a way that it makes an otherwise responsible and timely customer delinquent on their debts? I raised this question to the Wells Fargo staff who informed me this was "" just the way it is. '' To which I responded with skepticism, saying that this new system was probably just an inventive way of generating late fee revenues in a low interest rate environment. The representative said nothing. _x000D__x000D_I called Wells Fargo again today, XXXX/XXXX/2016, to ask about the status of the refund. I was told it would be returned in the same manner in which I paid -- electronically to my non Wells Fargo checking account. This is welcome news but in direct contradiction to what I was assured was the only method of refund just 1 business day prior. Even the representative today could n't explain the change ( which had not been pro-actively communicated to me in any way -- as far as I knew I should be watching for a paper check in the mail in 3 weeks time ). Was the initial response on Friday a way to make me open an account with Wells Fargo that I otherwise would n't have? I have no idea but the inconsistency is as unprofessional and unfair as the initial insistence on delayed paper check refund itself. _x000D__x000D_This is unacceptable behavior from a financial institution that has a responsibility to treat clients with respect and holds so much power over that individual 's credit history. _x000D_",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Wells Fargo & Company,NJ,070XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,3/29/16,Closed with explanation,No,No,1854602

No one has ever served us at all. This is n't about whether we owe a debt or not from 11 years ago. This is about their practices. We have also filed a complaint with the consumer agency in georgia. We have mailed a demand letter to XXXX County, demanding that they cancel this garnishment and our reasons why. We have faxed a copy of this letter to the Law firm/collections agency as well. We received notification that the fax succeeded. We also sent a letter to them as well. Lastly we have filed a complaint through the attorney generals office. We are also prepared to file a civil suit demanding that wages that have been garnished, be repaid, if it is n't stopped immediately. You can not go around illegally garnishing wages through illegal procedures. Our attorney says that we have a very good case and that they are in violation of the fdcpa as well on how they went about collecting this debt. If they want to contact me, they can. Not regarding collecting this debt though. This is regarding how they can avoid legal action period.

Consequently, I changed the provider of my bundled services. I contacted XXXX and advised them I was cancelling my service due to the above issues. I was informed I would pay an early cancellation penalty since I did not keep the service for the two year period. I informed the Customer Service representative I did not commit to a two year agreement and this was the first I was hearing from them. I did not receive any correspondence from XXXX at the time I agreed to the service with the XXXX representative. I received monthly bills from XXXX.

I asked XXXX why I was never informed about the violations and she said the two notifications they sent out came back.

I also verified with XXXX they had my correct email on file and asked her why was n't I notified via email when they saw the mail had gotten returned.

I spoke with XXXX at the collector 's office and told her that I was never notified of the debt I wanted to speak to someone about the fees being waived since due diligence was n't done.

The Complainants accepted the offer and proceeded to move from the apartment. Apparently, later senior management decided to renege on the manager 's offer, and after the Complainant left the apartment they sent the Complainant a bill for the early cancellation of the lease. _x000D_National Credit System, the debt collector, was allegedly contracted to collect the account. The Complainants had sent several letters to the debt collector explaining the situation, but the debt collector ignored the letters and continued to try to collect the alleged debt without verifying the Complainant 's information. The debt collector has not excised adequate due diligence to determine the validity of the account they are trying to collect despite request to so by the Complainants. The Consumer Financial Protection Board has stated in court case that the FDCPA "" grants consumers a legal right to truthful information in their dealings with debt collectors, '' the CFPB said, citing the Supreme Court 's XXXX ruling in XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ). _x000D__x000D_The debt collector in the Complainants case is in violation of the FDCPA as indicated by the CFPB due failure to provide the Complainants with truthful information.

See citation below. _x000D__x000D_The debt collector has engaged in unfair and deceptive acts, in violation of Regulation AA, by trying to collect a prescribed alleged debt and by providing a negative credit history to the credit bureaus to force the Complainants pay for debt that is not owed and a tool to collect a prescribed debt. This practice is also in violation of Fair Credit Reporting Act which prohibits creditors from providing false and inaccurate information to a credit bureau. The debtor failure to conduct adequate due diligence to determine the accuracy of the debt they are trying to collect after gaining knowledge of the disagreement with Apartment management and continuing to try to collect resulted in violation of the FCRA. The debt collector ignored the Complainants rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and purposely ignored the information provided by the Complainants with the willful intention of inflicting financial damage to the Complainants. _x000D__x000D_The Complainants in good faith recently offered to pay an amount of up to {$200.00} for the nuisance value of the debt 's collector action, but without accepting the alleged debt, however, the debt collector did not respond to the offer.

You will constantly head the sound of builders and machinery, and the amenities they promised you will either never be there of be built a year or more later. _x000D_They are petty and rude and have a relationship with a collection agency that will submit your name and social security number to XXXX and other credit bureaus on management 's request. _x000D_If you rent there you will be renting from fly by night builders that build apartment complexes sell them and leave town. _x000D_Watch out for the mold, leaks, thin floors and walls and a manager that is a mean realtor. _x000D_Fraud is the intentional use of deceit, a trick or some dishonest means to deprive another of his or her or its money, property or a legal right. A party who has lost something due to fraud is entitled to file a lawsuit for damages against the party acting fraudulently, and the damages may include punitive damages as a punishment or public example due to the malicious nature of the fraud. Quite often there are several persons involved in a scheme to commit fraud and each and all may be liable for the total damages. Inherent in fraud is an unjust advantage over another which injures that person or entity. It includes failing to point out a known mistake in a contract. There is a known mistake in a contract that was never pointed out to me by my broker. It also includes failing to not reveal a fact which he or she has a duty to communicate, such as not delivering promised amenities. My broker promised amenities including a tanning bed and garages as originally understood. The amenities of a tanning bed and garages were not delivered to me as promised. Constructive fraud can be proved by a showing of breach of legal duty such as lying about advertising amenities that were not delivered. Constructive fraud can be proved by a showing of breach of legal duty without direct proof of fraud or fraudulent intent. Extrinsic fraud occurs when deceit is employed to keep someone from exercising a right, such as a fair trial, by hiding evidence or misleading the opposing party in a lawsuit.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Resolve Partners, LLC",NC,280XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,5/19/16,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1884578

Per the military clause in our lease agreement we needed to provide the orders to the leasing office and give a 30 day move out this ensures the lease would be terminated properly without additional money being due ( i.e re-letting fee ). I followed the exact process and my move out was approved. During my final month in the apartment as I was packing I received a knock at the door it was the Sheriff bringing eviction paperwork. I informed the sheriff I was moving due to a PCS ( permanent change of station ) ordered by the military and he instructed me to go file an answer with the courthouse. I did just that. I brought the eviction paperwork from the sheriff, our orders, & the letter from the apartments approving the move out and the case was dismissed and we were allowed to continue our move out as scheduled without harassment.

XXXX XXXX 7 months from the courts dismissal the apartments were used as a reference on an application for a new home we were interested in renting, we were subsequently denied because a report was sent to the property management company saying we broke our lease.

I say this because my account was placed under AAFES Voluntary Payment Plan ( VPP ) program initially in XXXX because AAFES placed my account in collections after they increased my monthly payments without notification then locked me out of accessing my account because I was no longer in the Military. I got out the military in XXXX XXXX and had my account on auto-pay for AAFES to withdraw {$120.00} per month ( my minimum payment each month was about {$80.00} ). I later found out that my account was over 90 days past due because AAFES had increased my payments without notifying me to {$180.00} per month ; so although my direct payments of {$120.00} was received on time every month it was still in default because of a {$60.00} shortage. No notification was received from AAFES to inform me of my new monthly payment amount, nor did AAFES ever send me any notification that my account was past due. I found out of the delinquent account after trying to obtain credit and the creditor informed me that I had a past due account. Once I found out, I attempted to access my AAFES account online and realized that I no longer had access. I called AAFES and was told that since I was no longer in the Military my access was revoked. I explained to the representative that my access was limited after I got out the Military but I was given access to view my statements and pay on my account online. The representative told me that AAFES had revised that policy and so the only way I could access my account was by paper statements. I informed the representative that I had not received any paper statements and she told me that they would send XXXX out. I then asked how could I pay my account and I was told that the only way to correct it is to pay the full balance or settle through the Voluntary Payment Plan ( VPP ) program. This program required that I call every month to pay my bills. I complied with the rules of this program every month for the past 3.5 years. When I called to pay my bill in XXXX XXXX, AAFES notified me that they were making it easier for consumers to pay their debt so I could set up auto-pay which would relieve me of calling monthly. I requested to have my account set up on auto-payments thinking that AAFES had finally gotten better. Now I 'm finding out that this was a plight to defraud me and keep me in debt once again. _x000D__x000D_I requested to have my account set up on auto-payments where payments of {$180.00} would be debited from my bank account on the XXXX of every month. My XXXX XXXX statement showed that the money was debited as requested on the XXXX XXXX and my next withdrawal was set up for XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XXXX after returning from a 10 day vacation out of State, I received a statement from AAFES which was postmarked XXXX XXXX, XXXX. That statement showed that my account was 30 days past due in the amount of {$180.00} ; a fee of {$25.00} was added for NSF and my XXXX XXXX payment was reversed. I immediately checked my bank statement to see what was going on and verified that there was more than enough money in my account for AAFES to electronically pull the {$180.00} payment which they reported as NSF and charged me a {$25.00} NSF fee. I immediately called AAFES to find out why they charged me a NSF fee and reversed my payment if there was more than enough funds in my account. The representative placed me on hold then came back to ask me what is my bank account number. I verified my account number with her and she told me that they had the wrong account number on file.

I chose the later but with that decision came the need to access student loans, which have only increased personal stress because I 've reached a juncture of needing to finish with an XXXX Degree and then go onto to acquiring a XXXX Degree. I can not even afford to finish with the credits needed for the XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX, I was forced to make another difficult decision and I filed for Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy. Now, I know that Congress repealed discharging of XXXX, but, it is wrong that this government is making huge profits in high-interest loans from students who simply wish to better their station in life. We are taxpayers and in essence, make it possible for the government to loan us money we 've paid into the system in the first place. This government spends trillions in support of other countries and many of those countries ( like XXXX ) provide free tuition for those who wish to continue their education after high school. It is morally wrong for a country that spends XXXX dollars in funding the XXXX Military XXXX, taxpayer subsidies to corporations who outsource American jobs, the bail-out of XXXX XXXX at the tune of XXXX dollars, which to date amounts to close to XXXX dollars ... .all, again, at the American taxpayers expense.This government 's solution for assisting student 's with their debt? Determining their yearly income ( mine before taxes was around XXXX ) and basing a pay-back plan on that income. The amount I was told I would need to pay was XXXX per month. That would relegate me to XXXX per year in payments on XXXX, alone. My rent debt amounts to approximately XXXX per year. So ... .you can see that right now, before taxes, that would bring the total for just these XXXX debts to XXXX over a years time. I have to ask if our government has simply lost all sense of reality ( it certainly appears to be the case ), in which case you should get out of your taxpayer paid salaried political seats and join the real world. I am thoroughly disgusted in this government that I 've always defended. No longer can I defend a government that appears to be about serving party interests and pandering to XXXX XXXX rather than serving the people ... .you know ... .the XXXX %! Now, considering the total of just those XXXX debts ... .and take those amounts out of pre-taxed income, not considering any other living expenses ; do you not consider your objectives absurd. If not, you should, because you will be judged on you have grossly betrayed the American people in lieu of serving the dictates of your corporate master ; XXXX XXXX. I am sure my post will not be considered cow-towing ... which I am pretty sure is expected. But as elected leaders, and all tens of thousands of bureaucracies taxpayers make possible, is n't the term 'serving the people ' a fallacy? Should n't the term be ; 'taxpayers serving their government ' a far more appropriate term? Repaying this debt is going to be a major hardship. I am no longer a spring chicken ( sorry for the cliche ) but I continue to work hard. It grieves me to think that we come into this world with a relative few years to adulthood and then the remainder is serving our government without any of the perks we taxpayers have earned. Our government is rewarded for doing what, exactly? Yes, I am angry. I 've tried the positive energy route, to no avail. Stop punishing students and start rewarding those who excel in college with high GPA 's. My own GPA started out at XXXX and I ended with a XXXX. We students who are mired in debt need realistic solutions instead of the same old, very predictable responses from our elected 'leaders '!

Funds were levied from an account to which I have no financial interest & which contained the direct deposit proceeds of my mother 's social security benefit payments. The funds taken exceeded the maximum as stated. Funds were not posted or forwarded as I was told had been done and were held for a period of two years after seizure. Both organizations failed to respond in a timely manners with accurate information to my requests or to the requests made to each other resulting in an erroneous accrual of interest and continued damage to my credit rating. As a result of errors a second account was erroneously levied and an additional amount seized from a savings account which contained the proceeds of my husband 's Veteran 's Administration XXXX Benefits. To this date I have received false information and have yet to get resolution to this matter. I am seeking your assistance. The particulars follow. _x000D_Due to an unexpected job loss and {$80000.00} per annum in income coupled with a sudden increase in expenses my husband and I found ourselves in a difficult and very emotionally painful situation of having to renegotiate our credit card debt. We were unable to come to a resolution with XXXX and the balance continued to rise exponentially even though we were making payments. In lieu of this we decided to focus our efforts elsewhere and unfortunately the account went into default. The account was purchased by CACH/XXXX. A judgment was ordered by XXXX XXXX XXXX Court and a default judgment entered on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I did not fight the judgment because I did in fact owe the money. I did not agree with the amount but felt that there was little I could do. _x000D_On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX just before the XXXX Holiday when banks and businesses are closed, a levy was sent to XXXX in XXXX, AZ and funds in the amount of {$4800.00} were withdrawn. No notice was given and it was only discovered when my mother went to access her account. This account was my Mother 's Social Security direct deposit account. I was listed, along with my sister, as joint in the event that my mother needed emergency funds and was unable to access them for any reason. After multiple phone calls back and forth between myself, XXXX XXXX, and CACH/XXXX as I attempted to have the illegally seized funds returned to my mother without success I made an agreement with my mother to pay her back. At this point I considered the matter closed and made restitution to my mother. Over one year later, in XXXX I received a notice from CACH/XXXX stating that the amount was still outstanding. I immediately called them and after being transferred around several times talked with XXXX XXXX who assured me that the matter would be resolved and that the funds were with the XXXX County Sheriff 's Office. She would not give me a phone number or contact that I could follow up with stating that the matter was between them and the Sheriff 's Office. In XXXX, XXXX I received a letter from CACH/XXXX stating that they were willing to renegotiate the amount owed and wipe out up to 70 % of the debt.

Funds were levied from an account to which I have no financial interest & which contained the direct deposit proceeds of my mother 's social security benefit payments. The funds taken exceeded the maximum as stated. Funds were not posted or forwarded as I was told had been done and were held for a period of two years after seizure. Both organizations failed to respond in a timely manners with accurate information to my requests or to the requests made to each other resulting in an erroneous accrual of interest and continued damage to my credit rating. As a result of errors a second account was erroneously levied and an additional amount seized from a savings account which contained the proceeds of my husband 's Veteran 's Administration XXXX Benefits.

The particulars follow. _x000D_Due to an unexpected job loss and {$80000.00} per annum in income coupled with a sudden increase in expenses my husband and I found ourselves in a difficult and very emotionally painful situation of having to renegotiate our credit card debt. We were unable to come to a resolution with XXXX and the balance continued to rise exponentially even though we were making payments. In lieu of this we decided to focus our efforts elsewhere and unfortunately the account went into default. The account was purchased by XXXX XXXX. A judgment was ordered by XXXX XXXX Superior Court and a default judgment entered on XX/XX/XXXX. I did not fight the judgment because I did in fact owe the money. I did not agree with the amount but felt that there was little I could do. _x000D_On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX just before the XXXX XXXX when banks and businesses are closed, a levy was sent to Wells Fargo Bank in XXXX, AZ and funds in the amount of {$4800.00} were withdrawn. No notice was given and it was only discovered when my mother went to access her account. This account was my Mother 's Social Security direct deposit account. I was listed, along with my sister, as joint in the event that my mother needed emergency funds and was unable to access them for any reason. After multiple phone calls back and forth between myself, Wells Fargo, and XXXX as I attempted to have the illegally seized funds returned to my mother without success I made an agreement with my mother to pay her back. At this point I considered the matter closed and made restitution to my mother. Over one year later, in XX/XX/XXXX I received a notice from XXXX stating that the amount was still outstanding. I immediately called them and after being transferred around several times talked with XXXX XXXX who assured me that the matter would be resolved and that the funds were with the XXXX County Sheriff 's Office. She would not give me a phone number or contact that I could follow up with stating that the matter was between them and the Sheriff 's Office. XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from XXXX stating that they were willing to renegotiate the amount owed and wipe out up to XXXX % of the debt. As the XXXX season was approaching and I was dealing with a multitude of family issues I decided to contact them after the holiday the following week. Imagine my surprise when I went to access our savings account at XXXX only to discover that no funds were available because a lien had been served by XXXX and {$5100.00} had been seized.

That is when the clock started. According to the statute of limitations in California where I reside, these debts are past the statute of limitations period of four years. I was informed on Wednesday that one of these companies has obtained a judgment against me and will begin to garnish my wages effective XX/XX/XXXX, defying the laws of the state that clearly spell out that debt that is older than 4 years old can not be collected. In addition, this particular debt collection firm has filed suit against me ( documents enclosed ) These aggressive debt collectors have made it a mission to enforce debts that are barred by the statute of limitations. In good faith I negotiated with XXXX of the XXXX debt collecting companies a few years ago and I have been paying down this debt slowly. The other XXXX companies have been incessant in their continued pursuit. These are all open credit accounts debts and the debt collectors know that these debts are old and past the statute of limitations. They still proceeded to sue me. Now my professional reputation within the company I work for is very much negatively impacted, perhaps irreversibly. I have no idea what impact this wage garnishment issue will have on my future advancement chances and income earning potential. The imposed wage garnishment sums are so outlandish that I can not possibly stay financially viable ; I will crash. The XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX meltdown had terrible financial repercussions on my family and I. When people around me were declaring Chapter XXXX bankruptcy, I stuck it out and fought back in order to pay back loans. My house went into foreclosure three times and three times I saved it from this fate by providing mountains of bank-requested documentation, many times the day before the house went to auction.

I achieved new and promising employment XX/XX/XXXX and I was looking forward to a productive and contributory career advancement and now this. I find it appalling that the courts would allow for a lawsuit of this nature, in full knowledge that the cases fall outside of this state 's statute of limitations. My situation now is dire. After having fought back from the precipice more than once, I am besieged by an unlawful and unscrupulous turn of events. Mind you ; I successfully came back from the meltdown while dealing with both my mother and father 's illnesses and subsequent passing. I took care of them every day after work for four years.

693082,2016-03-11 00:00:00,Debt collection,I do not know,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"This began when I subscribed to XXXX XXXX internet service. _x000D_In my initial contact with XXXX XXXX there representative told me in order for them to supply internet service I would need modem. The rep gave me a precise description of the modem. I found and purchased that exact modem. _x000D_However, when the installer arrived to do the install he looked at the modem and said that is the wrong modem and I can not connect your service with that modem. I explained to him that their rep told me to buy that modem and showed him my notes with the reps name and contact information. He said, OH, they do n't know what they 're talking about, and went on to tell me which modem I needed, and I could order it from XXXX which I did. At that point I had over {$250.00} spent on Modems and they made no offer to cover my costs on the wrong modem I had purchased per their reps instruction. _x000D__x000D_So the installer hooked up the service with the which worked for about 2 months and then it started to go down every few days. About XXXX or XXXX times they were able to get it working again. The next time it went down however they were not able to get it working again. They said that they would need to come out and go inside my house and see what was wrong with my phone lines and that it would be a minimum charge of {$250.00} and could be more, perhaps even {$500.00} or more depending on what they found. I asked them if I paid there fee for coming out and doing what ever they were going to do if they would guarantee that I would then have reliable service. They said they could make no such guarantee. I also explained to them that my phone worked fine. I checked with my phone company to see if there could be something wrong with my phone lines considering the fact that my phone worked fine. The phone company said that would not be the case if my phone was working fine. I called back to XXXX XXXX and told them the phone company said my phone lines were fine and to please restore my service. I made several more calls to XXXX XXXX over the next couple months and continued for that time to pay their bill even though I had no service. On my last call I told them that they were in breach of the contract because they failed to provide the service I had been paying for, and that I would stop paying their bill if they did not restore my service. They said again that my phone lines had to be the problem and they would come out and try to fix the lines for the minimum charge of {$250.00}. I said I was not willing to risk another {$250.00} and perhaps more on the basis of what I had found out from the phone company and that they would not guarantee I would have reliable service even if I paid their additional charges. I told them to cancel the service and to stop billing me because I was not going to pay a bill for non existent service. So I stopped paying the bill because I had no service but they continued to bill me for another 4 months. They then sent me to collections for that additional 4 months of service which I did not get, just as I had not received the last 3 months of service which I had paid for. So the net result is that I paid over {$250.00} for XXXX modems which are useless to me, I paid for XXXX months of service and received less that 3 months service. So altogether I paid {$250.00} for modems, about {$180.00} for XXXX months of service, and I now have a collection on my credit report that is negatively affecting my credit score such that the mortgage I am applying for is going to cost thousands of dollars more due to this collection showing on my credit report for {$120.00}.

She indicated that she was going to sue the employer for a "" debt '' that has already been dealt with by more than one complaint filed with the CFPB. She received immediate communication back on XX/XX/XXXX. In addition, ECMC had claimed that it had retained California attorney, XXXX to defend it against FDCPA claims. XXXX office was contacted, and they continued to claim that his law firm was handling the matter and that there should n't be another attorney. Without respect to the confusion that was caused, multiple email forwards were sent to XXXX indicating that I do not have any debts owed with ECMC. She was told that she was not to contact my place of employment via certified mail, telephone, email and facsimile. She was immediately sent documents indicating that there was no Administrative Wage Garnishment in effect and that there was, therefore, no potential claim against my employer. Nevertheless, she still contacted my place of employment on XX/XX/XXXX, emailed the CEO, and spoke with the CEO twice. She then claimed that she would also be contacting the payroll company. After receiving a Cease and Desist and Notice of Intent to Sue, as well as having complaints filed with the CFPB, ECMC and its agents have contacted my workplace a minimum of an additional seven times and have contacted my former college to attempt to obtain records. Unfortunately for them, the records of the college - which have parts blacked out by either ECMC or the college - reveal that I was fraudulently classified as a law student ( I never applied to law school, and I, therefore, certainly did not attend law school ) and show that I made direct payments to them. This corresponds with my own receipts for payment, which I ordered a hard drive reader to be able to produce for their former attorney, XXXX. ECMC - under threat of lawsuit - and with direct proof of fraud, will not stop. Not only that, this situation has become much worse because my work has been contacted more times now than before I filed with the CFPB, and I have had to research additional agencies to turn to to receive assistance.

My phone is XXXX or XXXX. This all started when I received a letter in the mail from Delta Management XX/XX/XXXX stating that they were attempting to collect on my XXXX defaulted student loans. My loans had defaulted due to the fact that I had been in an accident with my XXXX causing me to be out of work because I was recovering from my injuries for several months. At the time, I was an XXXX. I was no longer able to work for myself, so I lost my XXXX. During this time, my wife divorced me because I was n't making enough money for her. I had to sell our home and move because she wanted the money and then I had child support payments for XXXX children as well. I had completely lost everything that I loved and I had very little money. I also lost my car. I had to file bankruptcy and try to get back on my feet. I do apologize that I allowed my loans to go into default, but I tried to reach out for help with no avail. When the letter came from Delta Management, I called and asked how I could get my XXXX loans out of default XX/XX/XXXX. The Delta Management rep told me that I had to agree to have my payments automatically deducted from my paycheck and that after 6 months of consistent payments they will take my XXXX loans out of default. So, I agreed and also I agreed to pay 4 payments each month instead of 1 payment in the hopes that I would decrease my balance owed quicker and show my willingness to pay. However, although I have been paying voluntarily, consistently 4 payments each month since XX/XX/XXXX, I have not had my loans taken out of default. I am a military veteran and I am currently in the process of purchasing a home for myself and my new wife, but the loan officer pulled my credit report and showed me that my XXXX student loans are still on my credit report in default status. I was made aware that I can not get a VA Loan unless my loans are out of default. I have paid what I agreed to with Delta Management and am still paying, yet nothing on their end has changed. I feel that I was defrauded by Delta Management and lied to by them just to get my money. I also notice that they have been taking a large amount of each payment as interest and collection agency fees. This amounts to a lot of money as I pay them each week. Is this accurate? Is it legal for Delta Management to not take my loans out of default? I have called repeatedly since XX/XX/XXXX,XX/XX/XXXX and have been told the same thing. I have asked for a supervisor, sent written disputes through their website, sent emails through their website and also the Department of Education with no response from either. although, the website says they will respond within a few days. Also, every time I called the Department of Education Debt Resolution Dept, they told me that I had to talk too Delta Management. Please help me because I have been trying so hard to get this fixed that I am going to call and write my Senator, Governor, Congressman and President of the United States.
